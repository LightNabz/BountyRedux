## 🔓 Cracked Server Support

Most bounty plugins render player skulls using Bukkit's offline player cache — which means skulls break the moment a player logs off, and cracked players never render at all.

This plugin fixes that properly:

- On every join, the player's skin texture (including SkinRestorer-injected skins) is cached directly into the local SQLite database
- Skulls are rendered from this texture cache — no dependency on whether the player is online, premium, or cracked
- Works out of the box with SkinRestorer — no extra configuration needed
